This directory contains a set of standard benchmark problems.
All problems are in a modified TSPLIB format that has become
the de facto standard for VRP instances.  The Christofides,
Golden, Li, and Taillard directory contain well-known instances
from the literature on heuristic methods for the VRP.

The VRPLIB directory contains instances that use integer-valued
distances that have been used more by those developing methods
for exact, optimal solutions to the VRP. Each .vrp file has
a corresponding .opt file that gives the optimal solution.
The VRPH/data/misc directory contains additional examples 
of some other types of problems supported by VRPH.

I added a BEST_KNOWN field to nearly all of these problems that
gives the best solution that I am aware of.  For the small
problems, it is often a proven optimal solution.  VRPH processes
the BEST_KNOWN field in these files and stores it in 
double VRP.best_known.
