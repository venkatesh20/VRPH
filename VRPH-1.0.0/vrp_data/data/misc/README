This directory contains a number of examples of properly formatted input files.

explicit_full.vrp
Single day VRP with an explicit symmetric full distance matrix

explicit_upper_row.vrp
Single day VRP with an explicit symmetric upper row distance matrix

service_time.vrp
Single day VRP with service times added at the individual nodes

multi_day.vrp
50-node multi-day VRP formatted in TSPLIB format.  
The NODE_COORD_SECTION gives the locations and the distances are Euclidean.

The DEMAND_SECTION indicates the days that a customer requires service.
A -1 indicates that the customer requires no service on that day.  
If a customer is visited, then we use the demand given for that
customer in the original Christofides instance.

The SERVICE_TIME_SECTION gives the service time at each node on each day. I only added service times to a few nodes as an example.  
The vrp_rtr executable can handle this file and generates a solution for day 1.
